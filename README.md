pdf attachment in product description for Zen Cart

You will be able to upload a pdf attachment to every product via the normal product editing in your Zen Cart admin panel. This can be useful if you have to show product data sheets or similar pdf documents to your visitors. You can define a description text (multilingual, similar to product names) for the pdf attachment. On the products detail page this text will show up below the product description (or whereever you want it) with a pdf icon linking to the pdf download file.
